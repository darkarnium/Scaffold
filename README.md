# Scaffold

## What now?
A Ruby scaffold of questionable quality. Your mileage may vary.

## Configuration?

Copy `bin/scaffold.dist.yaml` to `bin/scaffold.yaml`.

### Logging
To log to STDOUT, set:

```yaml
logger:
  destination: STDOUT
```

To log to a file, set:

```yaml
logger:
  destination: '/path/to/file.log''
```

## It doesn't work.
Probably! :)
